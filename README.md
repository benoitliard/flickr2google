# üöÄ Flickr to Google Photos Migration Tool

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my little project that helps you migrate your precious memories from Flickr to Google Photos. 

## Why This Exists

So here's the deal - I used to be a big Flickr fan back in the day. It was THE place for photo storage and sharing. But times change, right? Now I'm juggling multiple cloud services, and my wallet isn't too happy about it. 

With tons of storage already available on Google (thanks, Google One!), it made sense to consolidate everything there. Yeah, it's a bit sad to leave Flickr behind - it's like saying goodbye to an old friend. But hey, times are tough, and we gotta be practical! üí∏

## ‚ú® Features

- üì∏ Transfers complete albums with original quality
- üîÑ Smart duplicate detection (no more double uploads!)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flickr-to-google-photos.git
   cd flickr-to-google-photos   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   ```

3. Install dependencies:   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt   ```

4. Set up your credentials:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your Flickr API keys:     ```
     FLICKR_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
     FLICKR_API_SECRET=YOUR_API_SECRET     ```
   - Ensure `client_secrets.json` is in the project root directory

## üéÆ Usage

1. Run the script:   ```bash
   python src/main.py   ```

2. Follow the terminal prompts:
   - Option 1: Transfer a specific album
   - Option 2: Transfer all albums
   - q: Quit

## üìä Transfer Results

For each transferred album, you'll see:
- Total photos found
- Already existing photos (skipped)
- Newly transferred photos
- Failed transfers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- First-time usage requires Google Photos authorization through a browser
- The Google Photos API has a quota of 10,000 requests per day
- Flickr API has rate limits of 3,600 queries per hour
- Keep your API keys and client secrets secure and never commit them to version control
- Transfer duration depends on photo count and size
- For Google Photos API, you'll remain in "Testing" status unless you verify your app, which limits to 100 users
